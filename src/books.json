    "description": "Since his wife's death, architect Brendan Grant's heart has been in the deep freeze, iced up and impenetrable. Until a sick cat brings him reluctantly to Nora Anderson's door. Nora has a reputation for mending broken creatures, but Brendan wonders if her healing touch works on people too. For spending time with Nora and her orphaned nephew is defrosting his defences. But Nora is like a lioness, protecting the new life she has struggled to create for herself and her nephew. She won't let just anyone past the threshold.",
